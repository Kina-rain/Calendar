# Day Calendar 
This project was to set up a daily schedule for work day assignments. 
The calendar used color coding with time and text areas to define meeting and assignments that are due daily.
A save feature was used to store daily events. Moment.js was utilized to color coded and to apply date and time to the schedule.
